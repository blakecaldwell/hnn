# Installing HNN on Mac OS (Docker Toolbox)

## Prerequisite: XQuartz

1. Download the installer image (version 2.7.11 tested): https://www.xquartz.org/
2. Run the XQuartz.pkg installer within the image, granting privileges when requested.
3. Start the XQuartz application. An "X" icon will appear in the taskbar along with a terminal, signaling that XQuartz is waiting for connections. You can minimize the terminal, but do not close it.
4. **Important** - Open the XQuartz preferences and navigate to the "security" tab. Make sure "Authenticate connections" is unchecked and "Allow connections from network clients" is checked.

5. Quit X11 and the restart the application. This is needed for the setting above to take effect.

## Prerequisite: Docker Toolbox

1. Download the installer image: [Docker Toolbox for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/)
2. Run the installer, selecting any directory for installation.
3. Choose "Docker Quickstart Terminal" tool
4. You may get an error such as the one below. You need to grant Docker Quickstart Terminal permission to control you computer in System Preferences -> Security -> Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility. If it's already checked, uncheck it and check it again.
5. After a couple of minutes the "Waiting for an IP" task should complete.
6. Run the commands below in the same terminal window or by relaunching "Docker Quickstart Terminal".

## Start HNN

1. Verify that XQuartz and Docker are running. These will not start automatically after a reboot. To confirm that Docker is running properly, typing `docker info` should return a bunch of output, but no errors.

    ```bash
    $ docker info
    ```

2. Clone or download the [HNN repo](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn). **Chose one of the following methods:**
   * Option 1: Downloading a HNN release

     1. Download the source code (zip) for our latest HNN release from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn/releases)
     2. Open the .zip file and click "Extract all". Choose any destination folder on your machine.
     3. Open a cmd.exe window and change to the directory part of the extracted HNN release shown below:

        ```bash
        $ cd REPLACE-WITH-FOLDER-EXTRACTED-TO/hnn/installer/mac
        ```

   * Option 2: Cloning (requires Xcode Command Line Tools)

     1. Check that you have Git installed from a terminal window

        ```bash
        $ git version
        git version 2.17.2 (Apple Git-113)
        ```

     2. Type the following to clone the repo. If you already have a previous version of the repository, bring it up to date with the command `git pull origin master` instead of the `git clone` command below.

        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn.git
        $ cd hnn/installer/mac
        ```

3. Start the Docker container. Note: the jonescompneurolab/hnn Docker image will be downloaded from Docker Hub (about 2 GB). The `docker-compose` command can be used to manage Docker containers described in the specification file docker-compose.yml.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose run -e "DISPLAY=192.168.99.1:0" hnn

    Status: Downloaded newer image for jonescompneurolab/hnn:latest
    ```

4. The HNN GUI should show up. Make sure that you can run simulations by clicking the 'Run Simulation' button. This will run a simulation with the default configuration. After it completes, graphs should be displayed in the main window.
    * If starting the GUI doesn't work the first time, the first thing to check is XQuartz settings (see screnshot above). Then restart XQuartz and try starting the HNN container again.
5. You can now proceed to running the tutorials at https://hnn.brown.edu/index.php/tutorials/ . Some things to note:
   * A directory called "hnn" exists both inside the container (at /home/hnn_user/hnn) and outside (in the directory set by step 2) that can be used to share files between the container and your host OS.
   * The HNN repository with sample data and parameter files exists at /home/hnn_user/hnn_source_code.
   * If you run into problems starting the Docker container or the GUI is not displaying, please see the [Docker troubleshooting section](../docker/README.md#Troubleshooting)

## Updgrading to a new version of HNN

1. Verify that XQuartz and Docker are running. XQuartz will not start automatically after a reboot by default.
2. Open a terminal window

    ```bash
    $ cd hnn/installer/mac
    $ docker-compose up --no-start
    Recreating mac_hnn_1 ... done
    $ docker-compose run -e "DISPLAY=192.168.99.1:0" hnn
    ```

## Editing files within HNN container

You may want run commands or edit files within the container. To access a command shell in the container, start the container using `docker-compose run hnn` in one terminal window and open another terminal to use [`docker exec`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) as shown below:

```bash
$ docker exec -ti mac_hnn_1 bash
hnn_user@054ba0c64625:/home/hnn_user$
```

If you'd like to be able to copy files from the host OS without using the shared directory, you do so directly with [`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/).

## Uninstalling HNN

If you want to remove the container and 1.5 GB HNN image, run the following commands from a terminal window. You can then remove Docker Desktop by removing it from your Applications folder.

```bash
$ docker rm -f mac_hnn_1
$ docker rmi jonescompneurolab/hnn
```
