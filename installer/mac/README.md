# Installing HNN on Mac OS

This guide describes installing HNN on Mac OS. For recent Mac OS versions 10.12 (Sierra) and above, we recommend the Docker install. This method will automatically download the HNN Docker container image when HNN is started for the first time.
  * [10.12 (Sierra) or above: Docker Desktop](./docker-desktop.md)

For earlier versions of Mac OS, or if you want to install HNN without Docker, please see the instructions below.
  - Alternative: [Native install instructions (advanced users)](native_install.md)

Finally another option for users that are running into problems with the above methods, we provide a VirtualBox VM pre-installed with HNN.
